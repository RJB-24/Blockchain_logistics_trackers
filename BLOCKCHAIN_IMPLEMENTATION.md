# Blockchain Implementation for Supply Chain Management

This document describes the blockchain architecture used in our Supply Chain Logistics Tracker system.

## Architecture Overview

Our blockchain implementation uses a private permissioned blockchain for tracking supply chain events with a simulated public blockchain for verification and transparency.

### Key Components

1. **Transaction Layer**: Records supply chain events as transactions
2. **Smart Contract Layer**: Executes business logic automatically
3. **Verification Layer**: Provides immutable proof of events 
4. **Integration Layer**: Connects blockchain with traditional systems

## Blockchain Data Structure

### Supply Chain Events

Each tracked event is stored as a transaction on the blockchain:

```json
{
  "transactionHash": "0x8f28c31e9aa1be703461a19b6c347427d049b4e35ce10d313df7fdf7091d34ab",
  "blockNumber": 15482930,
  "timestamp": "2025-04-10T14:23:45Z",
  "eventType": "shipment_created",
  "data": {
    "shipmentId": "51fc9c36-a240-4b2c-8ff4-5c82c5d9a962",
    "origin": "Shanghai Port",
    "destination": "Rotterdam Harbor",
    "productType": "Electronics",
    "quantity": 120,
    "transportType": "ship",
    "carbonFootprint": 428.6
  },
  "signatures": {
    "creator": "0xA742a6Af8F4D193CEF887D7A932ADc0A3D410D74",
    "verifier": "0xEC9CaB5E02F0DaE3dE3C1e5A543C79F0B92e8f95"
  }
}
```

### Smart Contracts

The following smart contracts govern our supply chain operations:

1. **ShipmentRegistry**: Tracks creation and lifecycle of shipments
2. **TransportExecutor**: Manages transport operations and logistics
3. **CustomsClearance**: Automates customs documentation and compliance
4. **PaymentProcessor**: Handles conditional payments upon delivery
5. **CarbonCredits**: Issues and tracks sustainability tokens

    enum ShipmentStatus { Created, InTransit, Delivered, Disputed, Resolved }
    
    struct Shipment {

        uint256 _carbonFootprint
    ) public returns (bytes32) {
        require(shipments[_id].createdAt == 0, "Shipment already exists");
        
        Shipment memory newShipment = Shipment({
            id: _id,
            owner: msg.sender,
            carrier: _carrier,
            origin: _origin,
            destination: _destination,
            productType: _productType,

            status: ShipmentStatus.Created,
            createdAt: block.timestamp,
            updatedAt: block.timestamp
        });
        
        shipments[_id] = newShipment;
        userShipments[msg.sender].push(_id);
        
        emit ShipmentCreated(_id, msg.sender, block.timestamp);
        
        return _id;
    }
    
    function updateShipmentStatus(bytes32 _id, ShipmentStatus _status) public {
        Shipment storage shipment = shipments[_id];
        require(shipment.createdAt > 0, "Shipment does not exist");
        require(msg.sender == shipment.owner || msg.sender == shipment.carrier, "Not authorized");
        
        shipment.status = _status;
        shipment.updatedAt = block.timestamp;
        
        emit ShipmentUpdated(_id, _status, block.timestamp);
    }
    
    // Additional functions for shipment management...
}
```

### CarbonCredits

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract CarbonCredits is ERC20, Ownable {
    mapping(address => bool) public verifiers;
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public processedShipments;
    
    event CreditsIssued(address indexed account, uint256 amount, bytes32 shipmentId);
    
    constructor() ERC20("CarbonCredits", "CO2") {
        verifiers[msg.sender] = true;
    }
    
    function addVerifier(address _verifier) public onlyOwner {
        verifiers[_verifier] = true;
    }
    
    function removeVerifier(address _verifier) public onlyOwner {
        verifiers[_verifier] = false;
    }
    
    function issueCredits(address _account, uint256 _amount, bytes32 _shipmentId) public {
        require(verifiers[msg.sender], "Not authorized");
        require(!processedShipments[_shipmentId], "Shipment already processed");
        
        processedShipments[_shipmentId] = true;
        _mint(_account, _amount);
        
        emit CreditsIssued(_account, _amount, _shipmentId);
    }
}
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Current Implementation

In the current version, our application uses a blockchain simulation approach:

1. **Simulated Transactions**: We create transaction hashes and block numbers that mimic a real blockchain
2. **Verification API**: The blockchain-verify API endpoint simulates interaction with a blockchain network
3. **Smart Contract Logic**: Business rules are implemented in our backend but structured like smart contracts

### Production Implementation

To deploy in production with a real blockchain:

1. **Select Blockchain Platform**:
   - For private operation: Hyperledger Fabric or Quorum
   - For public verification: Ethereum or Polygon

2. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:
   - Use Truffle or Hardhat for deployment
   - Replace the blockchain-verify edge function with real blockchain connectors

3. **Key Management**:
   - Implement secure wallet management for participants
   - Use hardware security modules for key protection

4. **Consensus Mechanism**:
   - Private chain: Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)
   - Public chain: Proof of Stake (PoS)

## Integration Points

The system connects to blockchain at these key points:

1. **Shipment Creation**: Records new shipment data immutably
2. **Status Updates**: Logs all shipment status changes
3. **Sensor Data**: Records IoT sensor readings as blockchain events
4. **Customs Clearance**: Automates approval via smart contracts
5. **Delivery Confirmation**: Triggers payment release in smart contracts
6. **Carbon Credit Issuance**: Mints tokens based on sustainability metrics

## Security Considerations

1. **Private Keys**: Never store private keys in the application code
2. **Multi-Signature**: Require multiple approvals for critical operations
3. **Oracles**: Use trusted oracles for external data inputs
4. **Auditing**: Implement regular smart contract audits
5. **Circuit Breakers**: Include emergency stop functionality

## Migration Plan

To migrate from the simulated blockchain to a real implementation:

1. **Parallel Operation**: Run both systems in parallel during transition
2. **Data Migration**: Transfer historical data to the blockchain
3. **Client Updates**: Update client applications to use blockchain wallets
4. **API Compatibility**: Ensure API compatibility during transition
5. **Training**: Provide training for all stakeholders

## Future Enhancements

1. **Interchain Operations**: Enable multi-blockchain integration
2. **ZK-Proofs**: Implement zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive data
3. **DAO Governance**: Establish decentralized governance for the supply chain network
4. **NFT Integration**: Represent unique items as non-fungible tokens
5. **DeFi Integration**: Provide decentralized finance options for trade financing
