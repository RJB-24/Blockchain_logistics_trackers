# Supply Chain Management Edge Function

This edge function provides comprehensive blockchain-based supply chain management capabilities, enabling transparent and verifiable tracking of products throughout their lifecycle.

## Features

- **Event Recording**: Securely record all supply chain events on the blockchain
- **Product History Verification**: Verify the complete history of a product
- **Ownership Transfer**: Record transfers of product ownership with blockchain verification
- **Document Management**: Add and verify supply chain documents with tamper-proof hashing
- **Smart Contract Creation**: Deploy and manage supply chain smart contracts
- **Supply Chain Queries**: Run powerful queries on supply chain data

## Use Cases

### End-to-End Product Traceability

Track products from raw materials to consumer, with each step verified on blockchain:

1. Raw material sourcing and certification
2. Manufacturing and assembly processes
3. Quality control and certification
4. Distribution and transportation
5. Retail sale and final delivery

### Supply Chain Automation With Smart Contracts

Automate common supply chain processes with self-executing contracts:

1. Payment escrow and release based on delivery confirmation
2. Automatic customs clearance when required documents are submitted
3. Insurance claim processing for damaged goods
4. Penalty enforcement for missed delivery deadlines
5. Incentive distribution for sustainable practices

### Carbon Footprint Tracking

Monitor and optimize the environmental impact of supply chains:

1. Calculate emissions at each supply chain stage
2. Compare transport methods for sustainability
3. Issue verifiable carbon credits for green practices
4. Generate sustainability reports for regulatory compliance

## Request/Response Format

### Record Supply Chain Event
```json
// Request
{
  "action": "record_event",
  "shipmentId": "uuid-string",
  "eventData": {
    "type": "status_updated",
    "status": "in-transit",
    "location": {"lat": 40.7128, "lng": -74.0060},
    "notes": "Departed from warehouse"
  }
}

// Response
{
  "success": true,
  "event": {
    "id": "event-uuid",
    "shipment_id": "shipment-uuid",
    "event_type": "status_updated",
    "data": {...},
    "blockchain_tx_hash": "0x..."
  },
  "blockchainRecord": {
    "transactionHash": "0x...",
    "blockNumber": 15423890,
    "timestamp": "2023-04-28T12:34:56.789Z",
    "verified": true
  }
}
```

### Verify Product History
```json
// Request
{
  "action": "verify_product_history",
  "shipmentId": "uuid-string"
}

// Response
{
  "success": true,
  "shipment": {...},
  "events": [...],
  "verification": {
    "historyComplete": true,
    "verifiedOnBlockchain": true,
    "timeOfVerification": "2023-04-28T12:34:56.789Z",
    "verificationHash": "0x..."
  }
}
```

## Integration with Supply Chain Systems

This function can integrate with:

1. **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems**: Push and pull data from SAP, Oracle, etc.
2. **Warehouse Management Systems (WMS)**: Synchronize inventory and shipment data
3. **Transportation Management Systems (TMS)**: Track shipments and optimize routing
4. **IoT Devices**: Process sensor data from packages, vehicles, and storage facilities
5. **Regulatory Systems**: Submit required documentation to government agencies

## Blockchain Implementation

The current implementation simulates blockchain behavior, but can be easily connected to:

- **Public blockchains**: Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, etc.
- **Enterprise blockchains**: Hyperledger Fabric, R3 Corda, etc.
- **Specialized supply chain networks**: VeChain, OriginTrail, etc.

Connecting to a real blockchain requires:

1. Adding appropriate blockchain SDK
2. Configuring blockchain credentials
3. Implementing proper transaction handling
4. Setting up smart contract deployment pipelines

## Security and Privacy

The function implements multiple security and privacy mechanisms:

1. **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Share verification without revealing sensitive data
2. **Selective disclosure**: Control what information is shared with each party
3. **Data encryption**: Protect confidential business information
4. **Access control**: Ensure only authorized parties can access specific data
5. **Audit logging**: Track all data access and changes

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time supply chain visibility dashboards
- Machine learning for predictive analytics
- Integration with trade finance platforms
- Advanced IoT sensor integration
- Regulatory compliance automation
