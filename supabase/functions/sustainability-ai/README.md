# Sustainability AI Edge Function

This edge function provides AI-powered sustainability analysis and route optimization for supply chain logistics. It helps reduce carbon emissions, fuel consumption, and transportation costs while maintaining efficient delivery schedules.

## Features

- **Route optimization**: Find the most efficient delivery routes considering multiple factors
- **Multi-modal transport planning**: Optimize combinations of truck, rail, ship, and air transport
- **Carbon footprint analysis**: Calculate and minimize emissions across supply chains
- **Sustainability scoring**: Score routes and shipments on environmental impact
- **AI-powered recommendations**: Generate actionable sustainability suggestions

## Optimization Criteria

The route optimization algorithm can optimize for different criteria:

- **Carbon**: Minimize total carbon emissions (default)
- **Time**: Minimize total transport duration
- **Cost**: Minimize total transportation costs

## Optimization Algorithm

The current implementation uses a simplified greedy algorithm for route optimization. In a production environment, this would be replaced with more sophisticated approaches:

1. **For small routes (< 10 stops)**:
   - Exact algorithms like dynamic programming
   - Branch and bound methods

2. **For medium routes (10-50 stops)**:
   - Simulated annealing
   - Genetic algorithms
   - Ant colony optimization

3. **For large routes (50+ stops)**:
   - Hybrid heuristic approaches
   - Cluster-first, route-second methods
   - Neural network-based solutions

## Transport Mode Selection

The function intelligently selects transport modes based on:

- Distance between points
- Available infrastructure
- Time constraints
- Carbon emission goals
- Cost factors
- Cargo characteristics

## Integration Possibilities

This function can be extended to integrate with:

- **Weather APIs**: To account for weather conditions in route planning
- **Traffic APIs**: To incorporate real-time traffic data
- **Carbon Accounting Systems**: For precise carbon footprint calculation
- **IoT Platform**: To incorporate real-time sensor data for dynamic routing

## Future Enhancements

- Implement machine learning models for predictive route optimization
- Add consideration for vehicle characteristics (electric, hybrid, conventional)
- Incorporate real-time weather and traffic data
- Add support for time windows and delivery constraints
- Implement more sophisticated carbon accounting
